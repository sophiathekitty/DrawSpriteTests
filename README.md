# Draw Sprite Tests

I wanted to figure out how to do stuff with the Spites on the LCDs. This is the collection of classes i made to do some basic UI stuff. it has a menu system that lets you setup some buttons/actions with "btn #" (this script uses 1-5) and then based on the current action bar it will try to do those actions.

it also uses a GridInfo class i made to store data i want to access globally and save. some of the display classes can be bound to a var saved in GridInfo. these variables can also be sent to other programs by their program name. and GridInfo can handle checking messages from other programs.
