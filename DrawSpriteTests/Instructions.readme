Sprite Screen Tests
-----------

this is just me figuring out how to use the draw sprite stuff.
the screen classes should be able to draw text and sprites on a screen.
the action bar should be able to draw text spaced out along the bottom
of the screen.

you should be able to declair the screen and pass it the surface.
and then add sprites to the screen. if you want to update the text
of a sprite the add text sprite returns the sprite.

create a screen from a IMyTextSurface.

	progScreen = new Screen(Me.GetSurface(0));


then add sprites to the screen.

	progScreen.AddTextSprite(ScreenSprite.ScreenSpriteAnchor.TopCenter,new Vector2(0,0),1.5f,Color.White,"White","Header",TextAlignment.CENTER);


add an action bar to the bottom of the screen.

	progScreen.AddActionBar(5,"Up Down + - Back");

includes GridInfo for properties menu items. (with "bindable" properties)
